    A Job is an operation that can be delegated to the camera event loop to perform.

    Such as capturing and returning an image. Most jobs only do a single
    thing, like copying out a numpy array, and so consist of a single function
    that we pass to do this.

    But some jobs may take several frames to complete, for example if they involve
    mode switches, or waiting for certain controls to take effect. Here we need
    to submit a list of functions to perform, and as each function, representing
    a stage of the job, completes, then we will move on to the next function in
    the list when the next frame arrives.

    Jobs are normally created by the Picamera2.dispatch_functions method, though
    most common operations have dedicated methods to do this, such as
    Picamera2.switch_mode_and_capture_array.
